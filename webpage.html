    I would love to learn Shona because it is from Zimbabwe, a neighbouring country which feels more like a part of SA as we see many Zimbabweans in SA. Learning this language will make them see that we love them and appreciate them.

    Pretoria City Hall
    </h2>
    
    <p>
    Pretoria City Hall is a large building in Pretoria city centre, South Africa, which was built in 1931 and inaugurated in 1935 in order to celebrate the city-status of Pretoria obtained in 1931.[2] It is located on the Paul Kruger Street south of Church Square and across the street from the Transvaal Museum.
    <li>
        n 1926 a competition was held to design the future city hall of Pretoria and the winning design was by F.G. McIntosh. Due to the economic difficulties of the then South African Republic, construction of the City Hall started in 1931 and was completed in 1935.
    </li>
    
    <li>
        The Hall was completed in the Semi-Italian classical style and a George Heys, the former owner of Melrose House donated the 32 tower bells found in the hall today.
    </li>
    
    <li>
        The Pretorius Square lies in front of the building including fountains and maintained gardens. Three statues of significant figures decorate the park;
    
        Marthinus Wessel Pretorius, the founder of Pretoria who named the city in honour of his father in 1855.
        Andries Pretorius, a Voortrekker leader who led the push to settle the North of the country and for who the city is named.
        Chief Tshwane, the Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality, under which Pretoria falls was named for this local Chieftain.

    Church square, Pretoria
    </h2>
    
    <p>
        Church Square (Afrikaans: Kerkplein), originally Market Square (Dutch: Marktplein),is the square at the historic centre of the city of Pretoria, Gauteng, South Africa. The founder of Pretoria, Marthinus Pretorius, determined that the square be used as a market place and church yard. It was subsequently named for the church buildings that stood at the centre of the square from 1856 to 1905. The square's most prominent feature, since June 1954, is however the statue of the late Boer leader and president of the South African Republic, Paul Kruger, at its centre. Statues of four anonymous Boer citizen-soldiers surround that of Kruger on a lower level of the plinth.
    <li>
        Several historically and architecturally significant buildings surround the square: the Palace of Justice, the Old Capitol Theatre, the Tudor Chambers, the Ou Raadsaal (Old Council Chamber) and the General Post Office, which was designed by William Hawke.

    State theatre
    </h2>
    
    <p>
        The State Theatre in Pretoria, South Africa is the largest theatre complex in Africa. It was known until 1999 as the Pretoria State Theatre.
    <li>
        The theatre was built on the old Market Square in Pretoria for use by TRUK (Transvaal Performing Arts Council). It opened in 1981 with performances such as N. P. van Wyk Louw's Germanicus, Jochem van Bruggen's Ampie, and Arthur Miller's After the Fall.
    </li>
    
    <li>
        In 1999, the National Arts Council of South Africa made a five-year agreement with Spoornet to name the theatre the Spoornet State Theater, through which it not only supported the theatre financially but also promoted the arts and key performers while exposing passengers to their work.
    </li>
    
    <li>
        In 2000, the state of Gauteng decided to close the State Theatre over financial mismanagement. It reopened on April 4, 2001.
